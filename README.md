This is just a quick plugin to be used as a tutorial for anyone who wants to see a quick, functioning plugin.

This does not (yet) use the Data API. This is intended as a quick command/listener/scheduler thing right now.

Build with `./gradlew build` from this directory in the commandline, or use your IDE

See https://docs.spongepowered.org/stable/en/plugin/workspace/index.html for setting up your IDE.
